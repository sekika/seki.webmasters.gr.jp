<h1>Copyright of game score</h1>

<p>
Every now and then I find Japanese people discussing on the matter of
copyright of shogi (Japanese chess) game score on BBS and on mailing list.
In the world of chess, game score is not copyrighted and hundreds
of thousands of game score files, maybe even millions, in pgn format is
publicly available on the internet. A lot of people analyze these games
and this has helped improve the chess theory significantly.
To understand why game score of chess is not thought to be under copyright,
I asked a question on
<a href="http://www.shogi.net/shogi-l.html">The Shogi Discussion List</a>,
and the discussion was very helpful.
I list several important points here:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The actual moves of a chess game are not considered to be under copyright
because they are considered to fall into the category of 'facts' but not
'creation'.
<li>You cannot republish chess games that contain commentary
 by another individual without his consent. In this case, his comments do
 fall under the copyright law since they are the product of his 'creative'
 imagination. Annotations and commentary would have to be stripped out
 before reproducing a game record.
<li>The World Chess Federation (FIDE) seriously examined the
 possibility of copywriting chess scores, but gave up the idea.
<li><a href="http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/twic.html">The TWIC site</a> posts new games
every day, which is an example of how blank chess games fall into the realm
of the public domain.
<li>Anyone in the U.S. or most (perhaps all) of Europe would not have
 any legal problem with their own countries in freely exchanging game
 scores of chess or shogi.
<li>A collection of games could be copyrightable.
</ul>

<p>
The idea of copyright was introduced from Western countries to Japan,
and the basic idea of the Japanese copyright law cannot be very
different from Western copyright laws.
Therefore I think there is no legal ground that game scores
of shogi or chess is copyrightable even in Japan.
Actually this conclusion also agrees with most of the discussion
of this issue among Japanese.
