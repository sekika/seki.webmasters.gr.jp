<h1>What's new? and what will be new?</h1>

<h2>What will be new?</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a list of my idea for future revision of this page.
If you have any comments to these ideas, please let me know.
I don't know when I make these revision. Some of them may be
very soon, and others may not get into practice at all.
The idea is removed from this list as soon as it gets into practice.
<li>I will give "point" to every tsume shogi. It serves as an indicator of
the difficulty of the problem.
I also want to make the list of the amount of the total points you get.
<li>I am thinking of explaining tsume shogi rule in more detail.
For example, I should explain about "sakui" and "henka."
What are the proper translations of these terms?
<li>I want to make a glossary list of shogi terms.
The list contains English and Japanese name of the terms and
explanations.
It will not only help you to understand shogi terms, but also help Japanese to translate shogi terms into English.
Is there any such site? If you know, please tell me.
